 Automated Translation of Qiskit Quantum Circuit into Intel Quantum Simulator

We have developed a parser that adapts circuits from the most commonly used quantum computing languages, such as Qiskit, to Intel's IQS simulator (C/C++), thus facilitating access to this simulator for Qiskit users. Qiskit is an IBM library widely used by the scientific community for quantum circuit programming. In fact, IBM was a pioneer in providing public access to real quantum processors of up to 5 qubits in 2016. Since IQS requires the use of programming languages like C/C++, and most quantum circuits are programmed with Qiskit in Python, we have developed a parser that automatically translates Qiskit quantum circuits into a format compatible with IQS. This parser, implemented in Python, ensures the reliability of the translation and facilitates the use of the IQS simulator. Additionally, it allows performing translations from any QASM circuit. As a result, it generates a .cpp file that is compilable and executable in IQS, with a circuit equivalent to the original. We have tested the parser with circuits ranging from simple Hadamard gates to more complex implementations of Grover's algorithm, where we marked and amplified 1/4 of the total states, up to 34 qubits, and executed on systems with up to 256 cores, demonstrating its accuracy and efficiency.
